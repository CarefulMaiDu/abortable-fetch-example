# Abortable Fetch Example

A small demo showing how to use Abortable Fetch. Essentially every time you type it makes a network request, if you make a new keystroke before the old request has completed it will abort that fetch.

## Usage

To install the dependency necessary use:

`npm install`

You can then run the fake API using:

`npm run api`
